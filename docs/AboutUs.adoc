We are a team based in the http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg[School of Computing, National University of Singapore].
Our aim is to transform the AddressBook - Level 4 application into a Movie Scheduler that encompasses practical
features for real life usage. We target Cinema Managers who schedule the movies in each cinema, and the
respective timetable for each of the theaters in the cinemas.
