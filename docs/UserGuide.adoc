== Introduction

MoVie Planner is a desktop application designed for cinema managers to manage cinemas' schedules.
More importantly, MVP is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, MVP can get your scheduling tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!
